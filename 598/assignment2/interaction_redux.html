  <h1>Assignment 2: GIF Redux</h1>
  <h2>Kairavi Chahal | kchahal@uw.edu | October 14, 2017</h2>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      First-person view of a human interacting with a machine to complete a task.
      <h3>Rationale</h3>
      <h5>What did you hear during your critique?</h5>
      Almost everyone agreed that my narrative could use some more spicing up by introducing a problem or twist to the story. I also completely agree with this assessment, but was having a hard time figuring out what could be done to make the ATM have a problem.
      <h5>What did you do in response to your critique?</h5>
      The main feedback I focused on was strengthening the narrative. The first part was easy enough: setting up context for why I needed to go to the ATM, and adding a "time-passing" clip, i.e., me walking to the ATM. Introducing a problem or twist was a bit harder, because it would be hard to make something go wrong at the ATM for me to film. In the end, I decided to have a twist at the end, when everything seems to be going well, catching the viewer off-guard.
      <h5>Why did you choose to work with this GIF?</h5>
      I chose this GIF because it was my weakest GIF in terms of storytelling. Originally, it was hard to think of an interaction that was not just a single moment in time, so I was extremely focused on getting an interaction that had a beginning, middle and end in itself. While doing so, I sort of <em>lost the plot</em> and didn't end up with a compelling narrative. So I wanted to see if I could take this interaction further and make it more interesting to watch while also telling a story.
