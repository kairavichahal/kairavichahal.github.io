      <h3>Description</h3>
      My morning routine before heading to school.
      <h3>Rationale</h3>
      I took the prompt quite literally and filmed a version of a 'morning routine' as a series of actions that I do in the morning. While the narrative isn't the most compelling, I think I was successful in showing the beginning (brushing), the middle (coffee) and the end (leaving for school). I think the last shot was particularly effective, as the door closing sort of signals the ending.
      <br><br>
      Looking at the completed GIF, however, I feel that the narrative would have been more successfully depicted in a more continuous shot than a series of shots stitched together. Another thing that I had a lot of trouble with was properly depicting a complete narrative in such a short length of time. It would definitely be easier in a longer format video, where there is time to set up the context, etc. Another thing that I wanted to try would be some sort of stop-motion, since it is highly suitable for a GIF, but alas, did not have the skills or time for that!
