  <h1>Assignment 1: Make some GIFs (3 to be exact).</h1>

      3. <a href="experience.html">Experience</a><br>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      Experiencing doors closing — from the other side.
      <h3>Rationale</h3>
      While thinking of experience, I decided to not think about a single experience (like riding a roller coaster), but about how everyone has different experiences, and hence different perspectives. I went back to one of the ideas I had while thinking about interaction — opening a door. While it is a very simple and common action, I wanted to show that interaction from a different perspective — hence a series of shots where we can see a door closing, but from a perspective that you would not usually see it from — inside a drawer, microwave, fridge, mailbox, washer, dryer and garbage can.
      <br><br>
      I think since the clips were of similar lengths, there was a rhythm formed that makes the GIF pleasing to view. There is also a firm 'ending' to each clip, which makes it a lot more satisfying. I would definitely work on fine-tuning the angles of the shots, as well as the editing of where each clip starts and ends.
