      <h3>Description</h3>
      First-person view of a human interacting with a machine to complete a task.
      <h3>Rationale</h3>
      My first decision was to think of an interaction that I could easily film by myself, but also involved various steps that required a certain order. This would enable the interaction to have a beginning, middle and end. Most other interactions I thought of tended to be single-action, snapshot type actions (like opening a door). I also chose to shoot it in first-person view so that the interactions would be in focus, rather than be framed by some background. While filming, I shot the entire process in one take, but edited it down to only the key interactions in a series of cuts. Again this was to put the focus on the interactions (as well as to make it a suitable length).
      <br><br>
      I think the first-person view was a successful way to shoot it — seems appropriate for this kind of human-machine interaction, since the interaction itself tends to be private and only between the human and the machine. I was not entirely satisfied with the editing of the video, as some of the interactions were a bit too short and hence the GIF cuts away too quickly — before the viewer can fully take in what is happening. This is most apparent in where the human is selecting buttons on screen, as those tend to be quick interactions.
